# StreamKiste-Downloader

Just a Shell script to download movies from StreamKiste.

Make sure you don't run into the DNS block by using 9.9.9.9 or *DNS Over HTTPS*.

The logic is only layed out to use URLs from the **VOE** mirror!
When using the Mirror **Streamtape** you can just watch the Network tab of the browser and download that one file via e.g. **wget**.
